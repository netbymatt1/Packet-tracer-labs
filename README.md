# OSPF-Based Intercity Network Topology

### Overview
This lab simulates an OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) configuration between two cities — Virginia and New York — using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Each city has its own local network with a router, switch, and PCs. The routers are connected via a serial link and share routing information dynamically using the OSPF protocol.

### Topology Features

- **Dynamic Routing with OSPF**
- **Two Local Area Networks (LANs)** in different subnets:
  - Virginia LAN: 192.168.1.0/24
  - New York LAN: 192.168.2.0/24
- **Intercity Router Connection:** 10.0.0.0/30 link
- **Cisco Devices:** 2 Routers, 2 Switches, 4 PCs

---

### Objectives

- Enable full connectivity between PCs in different LANs
- Practice OSPF configuration commands via CLI
- Understand route propagation and inter-network communication

---

### Tools & Skills Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- CLI configuration (Router & Switch)
- IP addressing and subnetting
- OSPF protocol basics
